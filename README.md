## FOOD SECURITY MONITORING TOOL FOR KARAMOJA REGION, UGANDA.
## Introduction

As a Data Analyst, I have developed an interactive visualization tool using Tableau to display the 2017 crop season results for sorghum and maize yields in Karamoja, Uganda. It allows visualization at both district and sub-county levels, highlighting areas of low productivity to prioritize interventions. The dashboard is built using the provided datasets: shapefiles for Uganda districts and subcounties, crop type maps for sorghum and maize, and tabular data on yields and population.
